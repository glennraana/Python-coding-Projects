# Coding projects

### Different coding projects done in Python. 

* Chuck Norris APP:
  I made an app that connects to two API`s . One that collect random Chuck Norris jokes, and one Google API that translate the joke into Norwegian. I have also made a simple GUi in TKinter that displays the joke on a Flash card. 

* Password Manager: Made a small project in Python where i made a program that automatic makes a 11 digits random password and store it . 
I also installed a SQLLite3 database and the program push the data to the database when we push save . also a small script to cheek if data actualy are pushed to database.  Used Tkinter for GUI , SQLLite3 for database . 

* MAPGAME: A small game where we test how many states we are able to remember in US: Not a big project, but som fun logics to work with.

* Convert pictures: A small script that converts .HEIC pictures to JPG, nice to use in computer vision projects to convert many pictures at once.
